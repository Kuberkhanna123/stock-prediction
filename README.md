ML Based Stock Prediction Model

Here are 4 different files that I have uploaded and all 4 of them use different approaches to predict the stocks from the stock market.

The file ML.ipynb used simple CNN, ANN, TFANN, and Linear Regression

The file time_series_arima.ipynb uses ARIMA, i.e. AutoCorrelation Integrated Moving Average and Logistic Regression and is the most efficient out of all the codes.

The file untitled1.ipynb is a data-collector python code whcih can pull out the data of a particular stock. This code uses an API of Alpha Vantage for its functioning

The file untitled2.ipynb again is a ML based software which uses XGBRegressor and Linear Regression for its calculation.
